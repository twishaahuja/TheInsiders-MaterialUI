Exploring Material UI - Grid Layout.

# Problem Statement
Design a grid layout using Material UI's Grid component with three columns. Make sure that the columns automatically adjust their width based on the screen size, and each column should take up at least 150px but not exceed 1/3 of the container width. Build a layout with a header and a main content area using Material UI's Grid component. The header should span the entire width, and the main content area should have a sidebar on the right, with a width of 25% of the screen. Design a multi-section layout using Material UI's Grid component.
Create sections for a header, main content, sidebar, and footer. Distribute the main content and sidebar using a 3:1 ratio in a 4-column grid.
