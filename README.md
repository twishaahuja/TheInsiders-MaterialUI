# Material UI in React

MUI Series can be found under [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gAVLOVAFMwA0_n4nHtOUA). If you prefer the text version then I have you covered too! Just visit: [Medium Link](https://the-atypical-developer.medium.com/)
Iâ€™ve been working with Material UI for over a year now and I find this library very useful. During that time I learned how to use this library correctly and avoid the pitfalls that may be waiting when building an application using styled components.

I am creating these videos primarily for people starting out with React and/or MUI, but the following episodes will cover the more complex aspects of MUI, so anyone can learn from it.

# Branch structure

Main repository is basically a MUI Lesson #2 starter pack. The rest of the branches can be found under `lesson-x-info` where x represents the number of the lesson and info will define wether it's a starting point branch or completed lesson (f.e. `lesson-3-starting-point` or `lesson-7-completed`).
